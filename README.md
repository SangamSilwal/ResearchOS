## What it does

Give ResearchOS a goal. It spins up a team of specialized AI agents that collaborate to deliver a complete software project:

1. **Orchestrator** breaks your goal into ordered tasks
2. **Researcher** searches the web, arXiv, and GitHub for real, current information
3. **Architect** runs two competing models to propose a system design — a judge picks the stronger one
4. **Coder** generates each file from the winning architecture
5. **Critic** reviews every file (syntax check → import check → LLM quality review), sends failures back for revision
6. **Planner** (research-only goals) produces a concrete action plan instead of code

Generated files land directly in your working directory, ready to run.

</p>

The following diagram illustrates the overall ResearchOS workflow, showing how the specialized agents collaborate, interact with MCP servers, communicate with LLM providers, and produce the final software project.


---

## Web API

A multi-user, JSON-only REST API (FastAPI) -- no server-rendered pages;
build a React/Next.js (or any) frontend against it separately. Auth is
Google/GitHub OAuth issuing a JWT, per-user LLM provider keys are
encrypted at rest, and the database is Postgres (Supabase).

### Setup

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

1. **Database.** Create a Supabase project, grab its Postgres connection
   string (Project Settings -> Database -> Connection string -> URI),
   and put it in `.env` as `DATABASE_URL` (see `.env.example` -- swap
   `postgresql://` for `postgresql+asyncpg://`). Then run migrations:
   ```
   alembic upgrade head
   ```
2. **OAuth apps.** Create a Google OAuth client and a GitHub OAuth app
   (see `.env.example` for where), and register
   `{OAUTH_REDIRECT_BASE_URL}/auth/google/callback` and
   `.../auth/github/callback` as their redirect URIs. Put the
   client ID/secret pairs in `.env`.
3. **Platform default key.** Set `GROQ_API_KEY` in `.env`. Every agent
   defaults to Groq (see `web/model_defaults.py`), so this one key is
   enough for any new account to run goals immediately -- see
   "API keys & model selection" below.
4. **Run it:**
   ```
   python serve.py
   ```
   The two MCP servers (web search, arxiv) start automatically as
   background processes. `GET /health` should return `{"status": "ok"}`.

### Auth

```
GET  /auth/{google|github}/login      -- redirects to the provider's consent screen
GET  /auth/{google|github}/callback   -- provider redirects here; issues a JWT
GET  /auth/me                         -- current user (Authorization: Bearer <jwt>)
```
With `FRONTEND_URL` unset, `/callback` returns the JWT as JSON (handy
for testing via Swagger's "Authorize" button or curl). Once you have a
frontend, set `FRONTEND_URL` and it redirects there with `?token=...` instead.

### API keys & model selection

Every agent role (orchestrator, researcher, architect proposal A/B +
judge, planner, coder, critic, summarizer) defaults to Groq, billed to
the platform's own key -- **a new account can submit a goal with zero
configuration.** To use a different provider for a role, add your own
key for it and point that role at it:

```
PUT  /api/settings/keys/{gemini|mistral|openrouter}   {"api_key": "..."}
GET  /api/settings/keys                               -- providers you've configured (never returns the raw key)
DELETE /api/settings/keys/{provider}

GET  /api/settings/agent-models                       -- current model per role (yours or the default)
PUT  /api/settings/agent-models                        {"coder": "mistral/codestral-latest", ...}

GET  /api/settings/status                              -- which providers are configured / referenced-but-missing
```
Keys are encrypted (AES-256-GCM) before they touch the database --
see `web/crypto.py`. If you point a role at a provider you haven't
added a key for, that role silently falls back to the platform default
for that run rather than failing it; `GET /api/settings/status` tells
you when that's happening.

### Running a goal

```
POST /api/runs              {"goal": "...", "thread_id": "<uuid, optional>"}
GET  /api/runs               -- your run history
GET  /api/runs/{id}          -- status, summary, task breakdown
GET  /api/runs/{id}/stream   -- Server-Sent Events, live agent output
GET  /api/runs/{id}/download -- zip of any files the coder agent wrote (404 if it was a research-only run)
```

## Getting started

Two ways to run ResearchOS. Pick whichever suits you.


---

### Option A — Docker (recommended, no Python required)

Pull the pre-built image from the GitHub Container Registry and start everything with one command. Docker handles Python, dependencies, and the MCP servers automatically.

**1. Prerequisites**

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

```bash
docker --version
docker compose version
```

**2. Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SangamSilwal/ResearchOS.git
cd ResearchOS
```

**3. Configure API keys**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and fill in your keys. See [API Keys](#api-keys) below for where to get each one.

**4. Run**

```bash
docker compose up
```

Docker Compose pulls the latest image from `ghcr.io/sangamsilwal/researchos`, starts the Web Search and ArXiv MCP servers, and launches the agent workflow.

**Run a custom goal**

```bash
TASK="Build an AI chatbot using FastAPI and WebSockets" docker compose up
```

**Stop**

```bash
docker compose down
```

**Update to the latest image**

```bash
docker compose pull && docker compose up
```

---

### Option B — Run from source (requires Python 3.10+)

**1. Clone and install**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SangamSilwal/ResearchOS.git
cd ResearchOS
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

**2. Configure API keys**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your keys (see API Keys section below)
```

**3. Start the MCP servers** (two separate terminals)

```bash
# Terminal 1
python mcp_servers/web_search/server_web_search.py

# Terminal 2
python mcp_servers/arxiv_mcp/server_arxiv.py
```

**4. Run**

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project/folder
python /path/to/ResearchOS/run.py "Build a REST API with FastAPI and PostgreSQL"
```

Generated files are written into the directory you ran the command from.

---

## API keys

All keys go in your `.env` file. You only need the providers you intend to use — configure at least one LLM provider.

| Key | Where to get it | Required |
|-----|----------------|----------|
| `TAVILY_API_KEY` | [tavily.com](https://tavily.com) → Sign up → API Keys | Yes (web search) |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | [github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) → Generate new token (fine-grained, read-only public repos) | Yes (GitHub repo search) |
| `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | [aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) | If using Gemini models |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | [console.groq.com/keys](https://console.groq.com/keys) | If using Groq models |
| `MISTRAL_API_KEY` | [console.mistral.ai/api-keys](https://console.mistral.ai/api-keys) | If using Mistral models |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys) | If using OpenRouter models |
| `LANGCHAIN_API_KEY` | [smith.langchain.com](https://smith.langchain.com) → Settings → API Keys | Optional (LangSmith tracing) |

---

## Configuring models

Open `core/config.py`. Each agent uses a separately configurable model so you can mix providers — for example, use a fast/cheap model for research and a stronger one for architecture decisions:

```python
# core/config.py

orchestrator_model  = "mistral/mistral-small"       # parses the goal into tasks
researcher_model    = "groq/llama-3.1-8b-instant"   # synthesizes research summaries
architect_model_a   = "mistral/mistral-small"        # first competing architecture proposal
architect_model_b   = "openrouter/nvidia/..."        # second competing proposal
architect_judge_model = "google/gemini-1.5-pro"     # picks the stronger design
coder_model         = "mistral/mistral-small"        # generates each file
critic_model        = "mistral/mistral-small"        # reviews each file
planner_model       = "mistral/mistral-small"        # research-only action plans
```

Model strings follow the format `provider/model-name` as defined in `llm/router.py`. Any provider you have an API key for is usable in any slot.

## Output

Generated projects are written to the directory you run ResearchOS from:

```
your-project-folder/
├── app/
│   ├── main.py
│   ├── database.py
│   ├── models.py
│   └── ...
├── requirements.txt
├── .env.example
└── ...
```

When using Docker, output goes into the `workspace/` directory inside the repo:

```
workspace/
└── project-<id>/
    ├── backend/
    ├── frontend/
    ├── docs/
    └── ...
```

---

## MCP servers

| Server | Port | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| Web Search (Tavily) | 8000 | Internet search |
| ArXiv | 8001 | Academic paper retrieval |

Both start automatically under Docker. When running from source, start them manually (see Option B above).

## Troubleshooting

**Docker permission denied**

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
# Log out and log back in
```

**Missing API keys**

Check that all required keys are present in `.env`. The run will fail early with a clear message if a key is missing.

**`_unmatched/` files appearing**

These are a fallback when the architect's task list doesn't include an explicit `target_path` for a file — usually caused by a weaker/free-tier model not following the JSON schema precisely. Try using a larger model for `architect_model_a` / `architect_model_b` in `core/config.py`.

**Critic flags everything**

The most common cause is missing third-party packages — the architect's `dependencies` list was incomplete and pip couldn't install them before the import check ran. Check the flagged task's `critic_verdict` for `ModuleNotFoundError` details.
